# Lemos_CSCI2270_FINALPROJECT
  For my final Project I am going to use a binary search tree as the data structure, and I am going to use the text file from assignment 1 and use the craiglist idea. What I'm thinking is to create a binary search Tree of categories of similar items. And then each node will have a linked list in it with the similar items in it to the category. For example there will be a categoryfor chickens with differen chickens with different prices. And it will look for a similar item that a person will want with a similar price and take it out and delete from the tree if the person wants to buy it. Also if a person wants to put a item in there will be an insert item function. This is the idea so far/
